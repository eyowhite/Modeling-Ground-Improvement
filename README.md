### Project Description
Development of predictive models for soil strength using ML techniques, comparing stand-alone, tree-ensemble, and meta-ensemble approaches.

### Project Objectives
1. To predict soil strength with high accuracy using ML models.
2. To compare the performance of different ML models.
3. To establish the best model for soil strength prediction.

### Project Methodology
1. Data collection on soil and substitute materials.
2. Implementation of various ML models.
3. Evaluation of models using cross-validation methods.
4. Analysis and comparison of model outputs.
